## Update
**The large-scale generated motions for 500k+ objects, each with diverse objectives and currently MANO and Allegro hand models, are ready to download! If you are interested, just fill [this form](https://forms.gle/dNwaGvtb4ppi1HZt5) to get access! If you are interested in the code please also fill it so that we can keep you updated about the code release. We will also continuously enrich the dataset and keep you updated!**
